 * A programming organization is planning a contest for several programmers,

 * Each programmer is paired with another programmer,
 * and the difference between their ratings is referred to as the “bias amount”.
 * Given the ratings of all the programmers in the contest,
 * what is the minimum total bias amount that can be achieved by optimally planning the programmer pairs?
